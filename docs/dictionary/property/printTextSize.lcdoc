Name: printTextSize

Type: property

Syntax: set the printTextSize to <fontSize>

Summary:
Has no effect and is included for compatibility with
imported <HyperCard> stacks.

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop, server

Security: printing

Description:
In HyperCard, the <printTextSize> <property> specifies the font size of
printed text. In OpenXTalk, only <card(object)|cards> can be printed, and
the size of text on the <card(keyword)> is determined by the <textSize>
<property> of the <object|objects> that display text.

By default, the value of <printTextSize> is 14. A <handler> can set the
<property>, but the new setting has no effect.
